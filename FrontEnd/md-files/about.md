# Salz

**Salz** is pronounced like 'salt', drawing from the fact that the game
is very strongly inspired by [Halite](https://halite.io/),
which also based its name on salt.  
Salz is essentially Conway's Game of Life, 
made for a multiplayer universe,
where everyone build their own bots to play the game.
